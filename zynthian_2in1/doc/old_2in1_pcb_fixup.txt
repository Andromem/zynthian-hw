The first version of the zynthian_2in1 PCB miss a track and a fixup was
required. The photo shows the trick.

The repository version is fixed and update, so you don't need to fix
nothing if you are using the last version.

All PCBs distributed from 2016-09-01 are fixed. If you received the PCB
before that date, you need to fix it.
